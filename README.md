## About

### What is it?

This repository provides threshold multi-party computation protocols
such as threshold key generation and threshold decryption for TFHE, BFV and BGV.
Our protocols are designed to be both secure and robust when a fraction
of the parties are malicious.

This repository is an early sneak peak of what we aim to be part of our submission
for the [NIST call for Multi-Party Threshold Cryptography](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/threshold-cryptography).
It is also a preview of a part of a larger repository that we'll release later, where we open-source our HTTPZ key management system.

### Main features

- Threshold key generation for the three FHE schemes
- Distributed decryption for FHE ciphertexts with two techniques:
  - Using noise flooding (section 2.2.1 of the [spec](docs/CryptographicDocumentation.pdf))
  - Using bit decomposition (section 2.2.2 of the [spec](docs/CryptographicDocumentation.pdf))
- Resharing of FHE key shares
- Distributed setup for CRS (common reference string) using in ZK proofs

## Getting Started

### Installation

**TODO**

### A simple example

> [!Important]
> **threshold-fhe** is a snapshot of the work-in-progress code of what will eventually become a NIST submission. Use at your own risk!

The main way to use the repository is to run experiments and benchmarks on the various threshold protocols, which we describe in detail in the file [docs/threshold-benchmark.md](docs/threshold-benchmark.md).
It is also possible to use the the repository as a library (see the example in [examples/distributed_decryption.rs](examples/distributed_decryption.rs), but the public API is not well-documented yet, so use your own discretion.

**TODO: add a small but interesting example**

### Resources

- Blog post *TODO link*
- The [Noah's ark](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/815) paper contains the technical details of some of our protocols
- An [initial, preliminary version of our proposed NIST submission](docs/CryptographicDocumentation.pdf), which contains the detailed specification of all contained protocols

### Documentation

Documentation is current limited to the [docs](./docs/) repository. It will be extended when we open-source our larger repositoru.
