# Note that when the choreographers
# are running inside the docker compose they will have hostnames.
# But mobygo is running outside of the docker compose and it will
# not have access have those hostnames, this is why we set the
# physical_address to localhost as usual.
#
# Additionally, there is no need for TLS on the connection between
# moby (parties) and mobygo (choreographer) because these two components are only
# used for benchmarking.
